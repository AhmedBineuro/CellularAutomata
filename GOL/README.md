# **Game of Life**
## Game of life implementation in python using pygames.
---
This is a very rough implementation of the cellular automata simulation the Game of life by John Horton Conway. There are plans for this implementation in the future.
---
## Controls
- *0* to pause and unpause sim
- *Space* to select or deselect cell
- *C* to clear grid
### Future plans
- [ ] Slime Mold Simulation
- [ ] Average Color Mode
  - Meaning that the color of each cell will be an average of all of its neighbors
- [ ] Using cell system for pixel physics system
- [ ] Actual doctumentation
- [ ] GUI
